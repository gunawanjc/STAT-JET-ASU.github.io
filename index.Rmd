Computational statistics, data science, and reproducible research are critical for teaching and research at Appalachian State University. **STAT-JET-ASU** is a repository for educational materials I use in my statistics and data science courses at [Appalachian State University](http://www.appstate.edu/). It also provides collaborative space for many of my students as they strive toward greater proficiency in statistical methods, data management, and the use of reproducible research methods.

While statistics and data science are not synonymous, statisticians play a vital role in the evolution and leadership of the discipline (see [ASA Statement on the Role of Statistics in Data Science](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2015/10/01/asa-statement-on-the-role-of-statistics-in-data-science/)).
